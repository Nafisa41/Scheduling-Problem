Probable mismatch of teacher course and teacher schedule

### BUGS ###

1) [FIXED] Teacher's available slots are not being checked
2) [FIXED] Next slot should be called even if no course can be assigned at the current slot (This is why it wasn't reaching idx=25)
3) [FIXED] Next slot should be called after all possible assignments are done, not after a single one
4) [TEMPORARILY FIXED] Teacher available slots mismatched because teacher sequence in sheet 2 doesn't match with teacher sequence in sheet 3
5) There needs to be some mechanism to check if the course been done today already
6) [FIXED] Only 1 teacher is stored against each course in "teacher_course_mp"
7) [FIXED] Lab courses should be assigned only after ensuring ALL the teachers are free at that time
8) [FIXED] The condition in "read_course_teacher_free" would be
	if((start_time >= st and start_time < et) or (end_time > st and end_time <= et)):
instead of
	if((start_time >= st and start_time <= et) or (end_time >= st and end_time <= et)):



### FIXES ###
1) Added a loop in function "read_course_teacher_free" that checks if the start_time and end_time falls into any of the available time range of the teacher
2) func(idx+1) is called irrespective of what happens in the loop
3) func(idx+1) is called after the loop, not from inside the loop
4) Edited input sheet. But ideally, dataprocess.py should have been fixed instead. Instead of relying on the sequence, check for the teacher initial and store accordingly.
5) Implement a similar check like "teacher_time"/"year_time" called "course_time". Which will restrict reassignment of the same course more than once a day. A (day, course) pair is enough.
6) Edited dataprocess.py to store an array of teacher against each course in teacher_course_mp instead of a single teacher. Check ouput of "teacher_course_mp" before and after above.
7) Instead of setting the value of "teacher_free" based on 1 single teacher, run a loop for all the teachers who are going to take course simultaneously and AND their teacher_free value. Proceed only if ALL of them are True (available)
8) A class can start exactly at when another class ends, thus should be < instead of <=
